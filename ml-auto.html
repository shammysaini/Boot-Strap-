  CHENNAI: DMK chief MK Stalin has proposed the name of Congress president Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate for 2019. 
  "Rahul has got the ability to defeat fascist Modi government. Let's strengthen Rahul Gandhi's hands, let's save the country," 
  he said at an opposition event in Chennai.
However, opposition parties that are trying to stitch together an alliance to take on the BJP in the general elections, are not
 on board with Mr Stalin's idea, sources have told NDTV. Calling Mr Stalin's proposal premature, sources in the opposition say 
 the PM will only be decided after the election results.

Mr Gandhi and his mother and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi were in the Tamil Nadu capital today after the party's big victory in
 the Hindi heartland in what is seen as another show of opposition strength. The occasion was the unveiling of a statue of DMK


 patriarch M Karunanidhi, who died in August after a long illness. The two leaders, who attended the event after an invitation 
 from Mr Karunanidhi's son MK Stalin, shared stage with him.
